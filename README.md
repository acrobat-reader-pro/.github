# Pro Adobe Acrobat Reader 
Adobe Acrobat Pro is a powerful, all-in-one PDF solution. While the free Reader is a consumption tool (for reading and signing), Acrobat Pro is a production tool that allows you to fully create, edit, and manipulate PDF documents. It's the industry standard for professionals who work with documents, contracts, and forms.

1. PDF Editing: This is the most significant difference. With Acrobat Pro, you can:

- Edit text and images directly within a PDF.

- Change fonts, font sizes, and colors.

- Add, delete, or rearrange images.

- Fix typos or reformat paragraphs.

2. PDF Creation and Conversion:

- Create PDFs: Easily convert a wide range of file types (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images, web pages) into a single, high-quality PDF.

- Export/Convert PDFs: Convert PDFs back into editable formats like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, with the original formatting and layouts preserved.

3. Organizing and Merging Documents:

- Merge Files: Combine multiple PDFs and other file types into a single, organized PDF.

- Rearrange Pages: Reorder, insert, delete, and rotate pages within a PDF.

- Split Documents: Split a single PDF into multiple smaller files.

4. Advanced Forms:

- Create Fillable Forms: Convert existing documents into interactive, fillable PDF forms that can be completed electronically.

- Collect and Track Responses: Distribute forms and collect responses from users, tracking who has completed them.

5. Security and Protection:

- Password Protection: Encrypt PDFs with passwords to restrict access, editing, and printing.

- Redaction: Permanently remove sensitive information (text, images, and other data) from a PDF.

- Certification: Digitally sign and certify a document to ensure its authenticity and integrity.

6. Comparison and Review Tools:

- Compare Files: Automatically compare two versions of a PDF to quickly identify differences in text and images.

- Advanced Commenting: Workflows for collaborative review, where multiple people can add comments and annotations to a document.

7. Mobile and Cloud Integration:

Deep integration with Adobe Document Cloud, allowing you to access, edit, and sign PDFs from any device, including desktop, web, and mobile apps.

In summary, Adobe Acrobat Pro is for anyone who needs to actively create, modify, and manage PDF files as part of their professional workflow, whereas the free Adobe Acrobat Reader is sufficient for those who only need to view, print, and sign them.
